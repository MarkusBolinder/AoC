Solutions for Advent of Code written in Python, for now.
Currently, there are only solutions for 2023, however,
this will change sometime in the future when I have more time, 
and when more years pass - rather obviously.

Run the file in a terminal with ```python3 main.py < in```, where main.py contains the relevant code for that day.
Alternatively, you could go to the directory of a certain year, and execute the command ```python3 day_xx.py < ../today/in```.
There is really no need to explain all of this, although I want to make this README longer. When the program is run, in an appropriate way, 
two lines will be printed with the answer for the respective parts of that day.
